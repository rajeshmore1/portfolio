**This is My Portfolio website. **

completely developed in ReactJs.

I am a DATA SCIENCE and MACHINE LEARNING enthusiast, working as a Sr Data Scientist at Data Axle Pune. I am native of Ambajogai, Maharashtra.

I did my B.E. Mechanical Engineering from COE Ambajogai, M.Sc. Mathematics from Kalinga University and persuing Doctorate in Business Administration from SSBM Geneva.

I believe that the best way to learn something is by sharing what you learned, so we have started python and Data Science Club.I like making new connections and learning new things by sharing knowledge.

For any new project ping me, I always like to work on new ideas.
